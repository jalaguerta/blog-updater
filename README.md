# Blog Content Updater

The Blog Content Updater is a Python-based GUI application designed to streamline the process of updating blog content directly to a website hosted on GitHub Pages. Built with Tkinter, this tool appends blog entries with a title and body text to an existing HTML file. Each new post is timestamped and added directly under a specified header on the blog page. The application also automates the Git commands necessary to push the updated content to the GitHub repository, ensuring the live site reflects these changes almost immediately.
